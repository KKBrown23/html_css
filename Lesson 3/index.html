    <h1>The width of the elements in CSS</h1>
    <h2>Block elements and Inline elements</h2>
    <p>
      Block elements have a width of 100% (they strech all the way), so they
      don`t allow any other element to sit in the same row with them. Some block
      elements are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>h1</li>
      <li>p</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Inline elements have a width equal to their content (they don`t strech all
      the way).Some inline elements are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>img</li>
      <li>span</li>
      <li>button</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Spacing in CSS</h1>
    <h2>What is spacing in Css</h2>
    <p>
      Spacing in CSS is about giving the elements of the page the right space
      inside or outside the element's borders. We include spacing because when
      elements are close to each other the page doesn`t look cool, also it`s
      hard to read.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Spacing outside the border. We use margin to put space outside the borders
      of the elements. We do this in order to seperate 2 elements from each
      other.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Spacing inside the border. We use padding to put space inside the borders
      of the element. We do this in order to make the element look bigger.
